## Proof of work and Mining
# In a decentralized environment, common issues are:
- How do all nodes agree on what the current and future state of user account balances and contract interactions is?
- Who gets to add new blocks/transactions to a chain? How do we know any blocks added are "valid"?
- How the heck are all of these things coordinated without any central actor in place?
The answer is **consensus mechanisms**.
# The main consensus rules for proof-of-work typically look like religious commandments:

- You cannot double spend.
- The "longest" chain will be the one the rest of the nodes accept as the one "true" chain, determined by a chain's cumulative work. Also known as Nakamoto Consensus.
> Bitcoin being a blockchain network, use a consensus mechanism called proof-of-work. Ethereum was previously using proof of work but has since moved to proof-of-stake. 

# Mining
- Mining is process of creating a block of transactions to be added to a blockchain.
- mining is just an automated s/w that people run
    - there is no human element to mining except the setup + maintaince of h/w
### two main function of mining
1. enforcement of consensus rule
>consensus= a general agreement

    - no double spending,blocksize and validate all taxs
2. currency issuance
>so how does miners get reward?
comes the POW
# Proof of work
- Proof of Work
Proof-of-work is the consensus mechanism that allows decentralized networks like Bitcoin and (previously) Ethereum to come to consensus, or agree on things like account balances and the order of transactions. This prevents users from "double spending" their coins and ensures that everyone is following the rules, making proof-of-work-based networks resistant to attack. The consensus mechanism ends up providing security to a blockchain network just because it demands that everyone follow the consensus rules if they want to participate!

In proof-of-work, mining is the "work" itself.
>consensus= a general agreement
- a consensus mechanism is how decentrialized network(bitcoin,etheruem) decide what block/txt are considered "valid" and who get to add new block to the chain
- in order to add a block and recieve a reward, a miner must present some type of proof that they spent significant resource securing the network

- Proof of work and proof of stake are two diff type of consensus mechanism

POW is the solution to the mining process
# Proof of work Mining Algo
>when a miner mines a block what is the miner actually doing?

mining s/w **repeatedly hashes** a block of data(containing text) until a hash is found that meets a target difficulty
## Proof of work Mining Algo (looks like)
1. take the current block header
2. append a nonce, starting at nonce=0
3. hash data from #1 and #2
4. check hash versus target(provided by protocol)
5. if hash&lt;target, puzzle is solved!(valid POW) get rewarded.
6. else restart process from step #2 but increment nonce

## candidate block
```js
{
prevBlock:000000000000000000043f43161dc56a08ffd0727df1516c987f7b187f5194c6,
new_transactions:{
...,
Alice send bob 3 BTC,
Tenzin send bob 4.5 BTC
}
nonce:0
}
```
what miner do is increase the nonce
target diffuculties. bitcoin has 19 target difficulties (0 total in front count)
>000000000000000000043f43161dc56a08ffd0727df1516c987f7b187f5194c6

meaning it hard to find POW in bitcoin.
we need to find atleast 19 leading 0 hash. which is super 

>finding 1 leading 0 lead 16 tries

now suppose some one found the prevblock 19th, so you update the prevblock with the new found block and starts from nonce 0.

# summary
- In proof-of-work consensus, nodes in the network continuously attempt to extend the chain with new blocks these are the miners, nodes that contain mining software. Miners are in charge of extending a blockchain by adding blocks that contain "valid" transactions. In order to add a block, the network will ask miners for their 'proof-of-work'.
- Proof-of-work networks will typically have some sort of target_difficulty. In order for a miner to add a new block, they must find a proof-of-work lower than the network target difficulty. It's basically the network saying: "If you want to add a new block, you must provide a proof-of-work with 12 leading zeroes." The way the math works, finding such a difficult-to-find output is proof enough that a miner expended considerable resources to secure the network. There is no way to cheat the system, you either have a valid proof of work or you don't.
- the blockchain remains secure and resistant to attacks, ensuring that only valid and verified transactions are added to the distributed ledger, thus maintaining its integrity and trustworthiness.

## inshort
if the miner get the target diffiuculty the block is added to the blockchain. the prevblock is change to that and the nonce is set to 0 again and the mining again starts
