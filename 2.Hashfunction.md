## Hash Function
>function that takes  any size input and return the same output size

we will be looking on sha256 hash function
### SHA256
>gives 256 bit output
is a cryptographic hash function
- Properties
1. Deterministic
- talks about the output representation
suppose we put a picture in the function we will get a output(0xabc). i should expect the same output 10 year later (note that the input shouldnt be change)
2. Pseudorandom
- unpredictible
3. One-way
- It is not possible to guess the output based on the output of similar inputs
- If someone gives you a new output, you could not determine an input without guessing
- the only way is to guess the input
sha256 has 2^256 possibilities making it impossible to predict. if you dont know what the input is , you will never going to figure it out
4. Fast to Compute
5. Collision-resistant
- having two input, shouldnt create the same output. chances are there but very small

## two use case of hash function
1. Commitment(Protocol and smart Contract)
2. Proof of Work
