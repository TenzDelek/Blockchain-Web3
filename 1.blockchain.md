## Purpose
to decentralized where code runs and agree on the output
- no single owner of the code's execution
- the code always runs as programmed.
- the code is transparently verifiable

## blockchain Network
- blockchain: protocol connecting these machines.

- blockchain enforces these rules.
- since the program is enforced it is called 
<b>SMART CONTRACT</b>
